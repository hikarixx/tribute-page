                <p><strong>Brett Yang</strong> loves coffee and a good time, but what really keeps him waking up every day is his passion to make classical music fun and relevant for everyone. One of his highlight performances was at the 2014 G20 Summit in the presence of Obama, Merkel, Rousseff, Abe and other world leaders. He made his debut performing the Tchaikovsky violin concerto in 2012 with the Queensland Conservatorium Orchestra and later performed Mozart's Concerto No. 4 with Corda Spiritus. Since then he has worked professionally as a violinist in the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Queensland Symphony Orchestra and Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. He was concertmaster of the Australian Youth Orchestra and the Queensland Conservatorium Symphony. As a 2013 honours graduate at the Queensland Conservatorium, he was awarded the prestigious Brisbane Club Scholarship. His hobbies include reading manga, eating sushi and swimming. Brett is not afraid of cockroaches, but his anxiety increases in the presence of Eddy.</p>
                <p><strong>Eddy Chen</strong> has appeared as a soloist with the Queensland Symphony, Queensland Conservatorium Symphony, Queensland Youth, and Corda Spiritus of St Andrews orchestras. In 2010 he was awarded top prize in the Queensland Young Instrumentalist Competition and was a finalist in the prestigious National Youth Concerto Competition. In 2014 he was the Queensland finalist of the National Young Virtuoso Award. Eddy received his Bachelor of Music at the Queensland Conservatorium in 2014, where he studied under the guidance of Michele Walsh. While there, he won several scholarship prizes, including the Brisbane Club Award and the Ronald Clifford, Basil Jones Sonata, Owen Fletcher and Paganini prizes. As an orchestral musician, Eddy has been a casual violinist with the Queensland Symphony Orchestra since 2011 and with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra since 2014. He was concertmaster of the Queensland Conservatorium Opera Orchestra in 2012 and 2014. Eddy suffers from a severe fear of cockroaches, also known as katsaridaphobia.</p>
